Hi! My name is Sergiy Bagdasar. This is my personal website which includes a programming blog.
The initial reason I'd started it was to help software engineers feel more confident on their 
first day at work by writing about topics which are not properly covered in universities, but
are definitely part of your work from day 1. Everything I write is based on research and my
personal experience from working on multiple projects in the last few years. I hope you enjoy
it and if you do, leave comments under the posts and share them with others!

### A little bit of my personal background

I was born in Ukraine in 1992 where I also attended the primary school. In 2005 I moved to
Cyprus with my mum. I graduated with distinction from Aradippou Lyceum in 2011 and served
in the Cypriot army for 14 months until 2012. I studied computer science at the University
of Cyprus with a public scholarship until 2016. In 2016 I moved to Barcelona. I studied high
performance computing (with strong incline towards computer architecture) and received my
master degree from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in 2018. An idea for my own startup
brought me back to Cyprus for about a year. In 2019 I decided to develop my career in London
where I currently live and work as a `python` software engineer. I speak English, Greek and
Russian, but consider Greek as my main language. 

### Working experience (related to computer science, anyway)

- IT technician, Larnaca, 2012-2016.
    - I always liked taking things apart so it was a lot of fun. Broke my first laptop though.
- IT Assistant at the Computer Science department, University of Cyprus, 2013-2014.
- Teaching Computer Science to kids aged 8-11 based on the CODE education program, Larnaca, 2014-2016.
- Research Assistant at the Computer Science department, University of Cyprus for three months after graduating in 2016.
    - Topics: Compilers, Reversible Computing.
- In 2017 I started working on a project called *Loftedball*. I still do in my free time. Go [check it out](https://www.loftedball.com)!
    - Tech: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, Java, Android, Heroku.
- Since October 2019, I work as a python software engineer at [Yobota](https://yobota.xyz/). We power the best financial products out there (check [LiveLend](https://livelend.co/), [SmartSave](https://smartsavebank.co.uk/), [Fronted](https://fronted.rent/)). By the way, we are hiring!
    - Tech: Python, Django, DRF, Redis, SQL, Jenkins and more.

### Working experience (not LinkedIn material)

- House painter for a summer.
- House builder for a few summers & weekends.
- And 2 weeks as a garbage man in 2014, it was a temporary position and I was really good at it.

### Projects

Here are a couple of other projects worth mentioning:

- [MCE injection and tolerance at OS level](https://bitbucket.org/sbagda01/hardware-error-injection-analysis-and-tolerance-at-operating/src/master/). This work was done as part of my master dissertation in UPC.
    - If you are into computer architecture, check it out. It's about injecting, analyzing and preventing physical memory errors.
- [RISA](https://bitbucket.org/sbagda01/risa-emulator/src/master/) is a reversible instruction set emulator I developed for my dissertation in UCY.
    - If you are *really* into computer architecture go check the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/sbagda01/risa-emulator/wiki/Home).
